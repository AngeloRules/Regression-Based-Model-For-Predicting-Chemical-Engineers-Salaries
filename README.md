# Regression Based Model for predicting salaries of individuals in Chemical Engineering-Related professions.

The project is aimed at providing Chemical Engineering practitioners with information about the current job market in the USA and to also aid with providing a general idea on salaries they are expected to earn given certain criteria. The data was scraped from the employer rating site [Glassdoor.com](https://glassdoor.com). It features a salary predictor and a dashboard displaying some important information like geographical location of job postings, salary distribution based off different factors etc.

## Data Collection

The data was collected from the web and was done using selenium, a python library primarily used for automation. The data was collected regulary over the period of a month. Search terms like **"chemical process engineer"**,**"chemical engineer"** and **"process engineer"** were used to generate results for the web scraping.


## Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering

The data was cleaned using the pandas library.
